# Abstract

We are building an intelligent agricultural robot designed to improve farming efficiency. The robot will be capable of identifying and interacting with plants in the field, helping with tasks like pest control, fertilization, and targeted irrigation. By combining computer vision and automated systems, the robot will aim to perform these tasks autonomously with high precision.
